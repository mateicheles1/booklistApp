# booklistApp

App is still under development.
Future stuff will be added:
- save books in LocalStorage;
- load them up as soon as the DOM loads;
- being able to remove books from the list;
- being able to mark books as watched which will place them in a different category/list;
- being able to log into the app using fictional usernames and passwords due to the lack of backend dev;
- further design improvements;
